# KiepProjects
### Starting point for all Kiep related projects
The Kiep projects is a collection of tools created for our good friend Joost a.k.a. the Kiep. Joost suffered from an accident, making him unable to speak and limited body function. He has to communicate and interact with the world with 1 functioning arm and hand. Most of the tools are centered around the [Tobii Dynavox Communicator](http://www.tobiidynavox.com/) tool. Started with single button input a few years ago. Now using qwerty keyboard and a mouse, often in Windows, outside communicator tool.

Context:
 - Unable to talk
 - 1 functioning arm and hand
 - The functioning hand is very well developed, can make extreme gestures
 - Other arm and hand are completely non-functioning
 - Very limited control over legs and feet (wheelchair user)
 - Limited control over head motion (nodding is possible, but takes lot of effort)
 - Limited vision (one eye not usable and other eye limited usable)
 - Technical background
 - A Panasonic Toughbook running Windows 10 mounted on wheelchair
 - Fixed desktop PC with large 42" TV screen running Windows 10
